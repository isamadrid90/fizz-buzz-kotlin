# Fizz Buzz Kata in Kotlin

Do you remember this kata? It's one of the first that I did and I find it great to explain some concepts
with easy examples, find the requirements below.

## Requirements

* Write a program that prints one line for each number from 1 to 100
* For multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number
* For the multiples of five print Buzz instead of the number
* For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz instead of the number
* For numbers which are no multiples of three or five print the number

==================

## Extra

Additional content that you could find in this repo is a file calles MUTATIONS.md with a list of some mutations
that could be applied over the code and how to kill their mutants.
